# HealthyRide
Usage statistics and visualizations for the Pittsburgh bike share startup HealthyRide. Covers the initial 3 months after launch of the service in 2015.

HealthyRide recorded a total of 40083 trips in the first three months of operation, with an average trip duration of 57.17 minutes.

Stations were clustered by proximity (colors, figure 1). Flow of bicycles within and between station clusters are visualized with a chord plot (figure 2), chords ending in another cluster take bikes from there. The downtown clusters 1 and 2 are the most attractive, which is also born out by the number of bike pickups there (figure 3).

Results report including figures is too large to view directly on GitHub (3.4 Mb), but figures are available in their folder.
