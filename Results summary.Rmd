### Usage by location

Stations were clustered by proximity (colors,  figure 1). Flow of bicycles within and between station clusters are visualized with a chord plot (figure 2), chords ending in another cluster take bikes from there. The downtown clusters 1 and 2 are the most attractive, which is also born out by the number of bike pickups there (figure 3).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot1b
plot1a<- chordDiagram(cluster_to_cluster, color)
title("Bike rides to/from station clusters")
